Bot assistant for [u/beeznutsonly](https://www.reddit.com/u/beeznutsonly) and [r/romanticxxx](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanticxxx)

[u/beezassistant](https://www.reddit.com/u/beezassistant) is a Reddit bot that moderates the [r/romanticxxx](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanticxxx/) subreddit and performs several utility tasks such as storing scene info data from posts with scene info included, and automatically archiving said info on a publically accessible [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanticxxx/wiki/stars_archive). The bot is also tasked with carrying out some miscellaneous subreddit utility tasks and automated operations on my behalf.

Apologies if my code may seem ... not up to code; Python is not my "first language"â€”I hail from the land of curly braces, camelCases, semicolons, and the not-so-naughty stuff you guys do over here. I, however, did my best to try to provide a decent level of documentation by annotation, so hopefully even novice programmers can make a bit of sense of the madness.

Will certainly be refactoring the code and adding more features so be on the lookout.
